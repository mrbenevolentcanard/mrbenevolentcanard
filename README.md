## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ :D
My name is Albin and I'm a 17 year old Swedish high school student who codes on my freetime.
I'm a big aircraft nerd and most of the coding I do is for mods to the game/simulator [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [JAS-39C Gripen](https://github.com/whisky-actual/Community-JAS-39-C) and F-23A for DCS World and contributing on smaller projects.
- ðŸ“« The best way to contact me is through Discord, my user is mrbenevolentcanard.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++.
